## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

The project provides a pleasant and user-friendly experience for the user.

The user can easily access the content that he wants to display. All he has to do is click on the content he wants from the list of the sections, and the page will be scrolled automatically to the desired content.

When the user is browsing and scrolling, he will be able to easily know the Active Action displayed on the screen while scrolling.
